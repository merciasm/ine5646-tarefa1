### Feedback mecanism
For the matter of Development Web from UFSC, I should be able to develop a feedback mechanism in the listicle I've created for each post.

## Requirements:
* The buttons should have event listeners/handlers
* On click they should be activated and deactivated
* The page must be responsible

## Style:
* Text font: **Roboto Slab** (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab) with fallback for *serif* and color **darkslategray**
* Post's title font size: 24pt
* Subtitle's font size: 16pt
* Header banner height: 200px with padding: 20px
* Author's image height: 100px
* 66.76% wide centralized main section for content
* Post (rectangular area) padding: 25px on the top, 15px on the right, 10px bottom and 15px on the left
* Post margin: 20px on the top and bottom, and 10px on the right and left
* the button icons height: 30px, margin: 10px
* Button's opacity of 50%
* Likes/dislikes counter font color: **darkslategray**
* Likes/dislikes counter margin and padding of 0 fitting on 30% post width
* Buttons and counters in the horizontal (You can use flexbox) and vertical centrilized aligment
